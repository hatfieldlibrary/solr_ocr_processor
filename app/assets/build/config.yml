http_port:
  # The port used by the http service.
  "3000"
ip_whitelist:
  # IP addresses of whitelisted hosts. If the list is empty, all IP's can access the http service.
  # Example: ["127.0.0.1", "192.168.0.1"]
  []
dspace_host:
  # The DSpace api base url (no trailing slash)
  "http://localhost:8080/server"
manifest_base:
  # The base url for manifest ids in the solr index.
  # This can be the same as the "dspace_host" above. But if
  # you are running DSpace behind a proxy you need to
  # set this to the proxy base url in order for
  # manifest lookups to succeed. (no trailing slash)
  "http://localhost:8080/server"
solr_url:
  # The solr host (no trailing slash)
  "http://localhost:8983/solr"
solr_core:
  # The solr core name.
  "word_highlighting"
miniocr_conversion:
  # Covert input file format (ALTO or hOCR) to the MiniOcr format. Recommended.
  true
index_type:
  # You can use "lazy" or "full" indexing. If you choose "lazy" indexing the solr plugin
  # will retrieve ocr files from disk (lazy load) for each search result. This results in a
  # significantly smaller index but can have an effect on performance.
  # NOTE: If you choose full indexing you must update the solr schema.xml by commenting out
  # or removing the ExternalUtf8ContentFilterFactory charFilter.
  "lazy"
escape_utf8:
  # When "lazy" loading ocr files from disk you can improve performance by converting utf8 to xml-encoded
  # ascii strings. This setting is only applied if you have also chosen "lazy" indexing. Converting to
  # ascii reduces CPU load when lazy loading word highlights. If you choose this conversion be sure
  # to update DSpace IIIF configuration for encoding all search queries.
  false
xml_file_location:
  # The path used for OCR files on disk. Solr will read ocr files from this directory if "lazy" indexing is used.
  # (Use Windows file path for Windows.)
  "/var/ocr_files"
input_image_resolution:
  # ALTO files aren't required to use pixel units. If you have ALTO files that were created with units other than
  # pixels you are advised to update your files before submitting them to be indexed. However, this service
  # will attempt to convert 'inch1200' and 'mm10' units to pixels. When the unit is 'inch1200'
  # the conversion is in part based on the image resolution (dpi). The service will look for the resolution
  # in the ALTO processing elements. If it is not found, the default resolution below is used. You can change
  # the default resolution if needed.
  300
verbose_logging:
  # Log additional information during processing.
  false
log_dir:
  # The location of your log directory. (Use Windows file path for Windows.)
