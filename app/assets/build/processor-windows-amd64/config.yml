index_type:
  # You can use "lazy" or "full" indexing. If you choose "lazy" indexing the solr plugin
  # will retrieve ocr files from disk (lazy load) for each search result. This results in a
  # significantly smaller index but can have an effect on performance.
  # NOTE: If you choose full indexing you must update the solr schema.xml by commenting out
  # or removing the ExternalUtf8ContentFilterFactory charFilter.
  "lazy"
escape_utf8:
  # When "lazy" loading ocr files from disk you can improve performance by converting utf8 to xml-encoded
  # ascii strings. This setting is only applied if you have also chosen "lazy" indexing. Converting to
  # ascii reduces CPU load when lazy loading word highlights. If you choose this conversion be sure
  # to update DSpace IIIF configuration for encoding all search queries.
